In the spring and summer of 2019, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern BC (in collaboration with Hillcrest Geographics and the McLeod Lake Indian Band) conducted a literature and database review for the Parsnip River watershed to identify candidates for Fish Habitat Confirmation Assessments related to fish passage restoration planning.  Crossings identified as known or potential barriers to fish passage in the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory Database (PSCIS) were analyzed within the context of the British Columbia Fish Habitat Model [@fish_habitat_model] and background fisheries information to identify crossings with potentially high fisheries value as well as large amounts of potential habitat upstream and prioritize these for further assessment. Prioritization rankings were assigned based on upstream wetland, lake, and instream habitat quantity, and quality; fish species present, or suspected, at the crossing; and recommendations of past fish passage assessments [@gollnerPrinceGeorgeTimber2013; @hooftPrinceGeorgeForest].

<br>

The habitat confirmation was completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” [@confirmation_checklist]. The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Criteria used to rank habitat value is specified in @confirmation_checklist and summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tablehabvalue).

The culvert is located on a `r my_overview_info %>% pull(stream_name)` under `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` ~2km upstream of the confluence with the Parsnip River and approximatley 9km north-west of the outlet of Artic Lake (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview)). Arctic Lake is located within Arctic Pacific Lakes Provincial Park.  At the time of the field surveys, a small remote logging camp was located approximately 3.5km to the north-west of the crossing location and active logging was occurring on the east side of the Parsnip River valley adjacent to the camp. @data_fish_obs indicate that fish have not previously been recorded in the stream.  The watershed upstream of the crossing drains an area of `r my_watershed %>% pull(area_km)`km^2^ from an maximum elevation of approximately 1600m.  There are no other stream crossing (culvert) barriers on the mainstem of the stream upstream of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` although one crossing is modelled as located on a tributary upstream. 



<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to upstream wetland (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(upstr_awet_gross_all)`ha) and instream (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) habitat and because it was ranked by @hooftPrinceGeorgeForest as a high priority for follow up (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning)). 

<br>

The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 – Map `r my_overview_info %>% pull(dbm_mof_50k_grid_map_tile)`.  At the time of the survey, the culvert  was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a length of ~`r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)` m and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-outlet)).

```


The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert continuosly for 330m to a beaver influenced wetland area where walking became difficult (UTM:10N 577830 6038053).  The stream was accessed again from logging roads at points 1.6km upstream from the crossing then again at approximately 2.5km upstream of the crossing. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat)). Undercut banks, large woody debris and overhanging vegetation were abundant througout the surveyed area and gravels suitable for spawning were located within all upstream areas surveyed (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2). An unmanned aerial vehicle was utilized to capture footage of upstream habitat and is available [here at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT6cEmNK3f4).  Minnowtrapping was conducted upstream of the crossing with no fish captured. An upstream crossing location was
