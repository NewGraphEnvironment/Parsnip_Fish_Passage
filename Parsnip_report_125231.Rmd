##### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed tributary to the Table River near the 20km mark of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)`.  The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km from the confluence of the Table River on the upstream side of the CN Railway (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview-125231)). At the time of the field surveys, there was active log hauling on the FSR. 


<br>

##### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is a 3rd order stream with a watershed area upstream of the road of `r my_watershed %>% pull(area_km)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1400m to 760m at the culvert.  One previously unassessed crossing (16603641) is located upstream (450m) and previously unassessed crossing (16603278) is located downstream 210m under the CN Railway. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that Rainbow Trout have been captured just upstream of the crossing and Rainbow Trout and Sucker species have captured downstream [@data_fish_obs; @zemlakFishSpeciesPresence1995].

<br>

@hagen_2015_critical_habs have identified the Table River watershed and several tributaries as containing critical spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for large body Bull Trout with an estimated minimum spawner abundance of 100 fish. 

<br>

The Table River (along with the Anzac River) is identified as the primary core of post-Williston Arctic Grayling distribution in the Parsnip River watershed with life history, migration behaviours and critical habitats summarized in @hagen_2015_critical_habs.  The mainstem of the Table River contains critical habitats for all life stages of Arctic Grayling with adults observed moving among mainstem locations and tributaries during summer [@hagen_2015_critical_habs].  


<br>

In 2018, the Table River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* (FSW identifier f-7-022) due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity [@table_sens]. Special management is required in the crossing's watershed to protect habitat for Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].



<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to modeled instream habitat (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) with a relatively large channel size (`r my_planning_data %>% pull(downstream_channel_width)`m) and Rainbow Trout documented upstream (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning-125231)). The habitat confirmation was completed on September 4, 2019 (downstream) and `r date` (upstream). A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered double (`r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m each) crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with pipe lengths of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert-125231), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert-125231)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

drake::readd(table_habitat_report) %>% filter(Site == my_site) %>% pull(Comments)
drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

##### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m to within the floodplain of the Table River. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1-125231) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2-125231)). Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()`. Gravels suitable for spawning were abundant throughout the area surveyed. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125231)). Habitat value downstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`.

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m to 100m above the location of a newly installed bridge (modeled crossing 16603641, Figure \@ref(fig:photo-upstream3-125231)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125231)). Riparian vegetation was comprised of a mature coniferous forest and instream cover quantity was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)`.  The dominant cover form of cover was `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` with `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available. Gravels suitable for spawning were present intermittently throughout the area surveyed (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1-125231) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2-125231)). Although there were no permanent barriers, some debris steps from 30 - 70 cms high were located throughout. Habitat value upstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`.


<br>


##### Conclusion

There is approximately 2.2km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r my_site` modeled as less than 22% gradient. Habitat surveyed was rated as high value for salmonids with Rainbow Trout presence confirmed upstream of the crossing [@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.Reconnaissance200001999]. Bull Trout is known to utilize adjacent streams of similiar size and topography within the vicinity of this stream and the watershed is designated as Fisheries Sensitive with critical habitat for Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling spawning as well as critical rearing habitat for Bull Trout juveniles and Arctic Grayling fry known in the Table River system.  The forest licensees in the area are Sinclar Group and Canfor and the road tenure holder is the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. Overall, the crossing located on the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation.
