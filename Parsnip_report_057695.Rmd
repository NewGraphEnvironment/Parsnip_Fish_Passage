## Crossing `r my_site` - `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` - `r my_overview_info %>% pull(stream_name)`

```{r}
# test <- pull_data(sheet = loc_data, site = my_site)
##have a look at the watershed
# ggplot(data = my_watershed)+
#   geom_sf(data = my_watershed, lwd = 0.15)
```

### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(stream_name)` near the `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(road_km_mark)`km mark of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)`.  The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km from the confluence with Wichcika Creek (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview-57695)). At the time of the field surveys, there appeared to be no active log hauling on the FSR however their was a mining exploration camp on the road roughly near the 5km mark and some pickup truck traffic was encountered. 


<br>

### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is 2nd order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately `r my_watershed %>% mutate(area_km = area_km + 0.5) %>%  pull(area_km)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1500m to 1100m at the culvert. No other crossings are modeled upstream. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that Bull Trout were captured downstream of the crossing approximately 400m as well as near the mouth of the stream by DWB in 2016 [@data_fish_obs].

<br>

@hagen_2015_critical_habs have identified the upper end of the Wichcika Creek mainstem as containing critical spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for large body Bull Trout with an estimated minimum spawner abundance of less than 50 fish. 


<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to modeled instream (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) habitat with a relatively large channel size (`r my_planning_data %>% pull(downstream_channel_width)`m) and potentially high value habitat as indicated by contractor habitat value assignment.  Additionally, @gollnerPrinceGeorgeTimber2013 prioritized the crossing for follow up (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning-57695)). The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert-57695), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert-57695)).

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

drake::readd(table_habitat_report) %>% filter(Site == my_site) %>% pull(Comments)
drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m to below the point where Bull Trout were observed by DWB in 2016. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` and extensive areas of gravels suitable for spawning present (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1-57695) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2-57695)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-57695)).  The stable, mature channel contained  drops up to 0.6m high resulting from large woody debris. Three minnowtraps were set overnight within the 50m of channel directly below the culvert. No fish were captured. Habitat value upstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`.

<br>

### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m.  The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-57695)). Riparian vegetation was comprised of a mature coniferous forest and total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)`. The dominant cover form was `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` with `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1-57695) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2-57695)). Some gravels suitable for spawning were present. No obstacles to fish passage were observed in the area surveyed with the exception of debris jams ranging from 50 - 100 cm in height (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-upstream3-57695)). Three minnowtraps were set overnight within the 50m of channel directly above the culvert. No fish were captured. Habitat value upstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`. 


<br>


### Conclusion

There is 1.5km of mainstem habitat modeled as less than 22% gradient upstream of crossing `r my_site`. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing was rated as moderate value for salmonids with Bull Trout presence confirmed downstream of the FSR. Review of Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development (FLNR) licensee operating areas maps indicate that the forest licensee in the area is Sinclar Group.  The road tenure holder is FLNR. As the crossing location appears to be important migration corridor with habitat upstream with moderate rearing potential for Bull Trout the crossing was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation.
