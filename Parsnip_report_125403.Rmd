##### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(stream_name)` near the `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(road_km_mark)`km mark of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)`. The culvert is also recorded in the PSCIS database as crossing 57606. The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km upstream from the confluence of the stream and the Parsnip River (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview-125403)). At the time of the field surveys, there appeared to be no active log hauling on the FSR. 


<br>

##### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is 2nd order with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately `r my_watershed %>% mutate(area_km = area_km + 1) %>%  pull(area_km)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 900m to 750m at the culvert. One PSCIS crossing (57608) and several modeled crossings (79706, 189512, 190084, 79707, 7289, 6472) are located upstream on small tributaries to the mainstem of the subject stream. Provincial records indicate that there is no fisheries information available for the stream [@data_fish_obs:1; @moeStreamInventorySample].

<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to modeled instream (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) habitat with a relatively large channel size (`r my_planning_data %>% pull(downstream_channel_width)`m) and potentially high value habitat as indicated by contractor habitat value assignment (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning-125403)). Of note, @hooftPrinceGeorgeForest had prioritized this crossing for rehabilitation ranking it 13th of 18 priorities identified. The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert-125403), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert-125403)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C, pH was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(p_h)` and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

drake::readd(table_habitat_report) %>% filter(Site == my_site) %>% pull(Comments)
drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

##### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m to within the floodplain of the Parsnip River. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant. Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1-125403) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2-125403)). The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125403)).  Riparian vegetation was primarily shrubs and streambed substrates were dominated by fines. One salmonid parr (suspected Rainbow Trout - 120mm fork length) was observed in a small pool area located approximately 20m downstream of the culvert. 

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m.  The initial 50m of habitat upstream of the crossing was shallow beaver influenced wetland with a section of small channel flowing for approximately 150m from an extensive beaver influenced wetland complex located upstream (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1-125403) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2-125403)).  The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125403)). Riparian vegetation was comprised of a young coniferous forest. Total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)` with the dominant form as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` and `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available.  Upstream of the crossing, habitat was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()` value due to a lack of areas suitable for spawning, and the apparently shallow depths of the majority of upstream wetland habitat present. 


<br>


##### Conclusion

There is an estimated 2.4km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r my_site` within a beaver influenced plateau. Habitat in the areas surveyed upstream of the crossing was rated as low value. Review of Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development (FLNR) licensee operating areas maps indicate that the forest licensees in the area were BCTS and Canfor Forest Products Ltd. and the road tenure holder was the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development [@moeForestTenureRoad2019].  The crossing was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat and likely shallow depths of upstream wetland habitat present.
