### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed tributary to the Missinka River near the 12km mark of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)`.  The culvert is located approximately 660m east of surveyed crossing 125180 and joins this adjacent stream just before emptying into the Missinka River `r my_distance_downstream`km downstream of the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview)). At the time of the field surveys, there was very little traffic on the FSR and it appeared as though there was no active logging. The forest licensee in the area is Canfor Forest Products and the road tenure holder is the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. 

<br>

### Background Information

The unnamed tributary to the Missinka River is a 2nd order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of `r my_watershed %>% pull(area_km)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1700m to 800m at the culvert.  There are no other stream crossing (culvert) barriers on the mainstem of the stream upstream of the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)`. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that in 1998 there were Rainbow Trout captured upstream [@data_fish_obs; @tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.Reconnaissance200001999]. @hagen_2015_critical_habs have identified the Missinka River watershed as containing critical spawning habitat for large body adult Bull Trout with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing the watershed.  Critical juvenile rearing habitat is also noted as present in the Missinka River watershed [@hagen_2015_critical_habs]. The Missinka River watershed is utilized by a possibly genetically distinct, self-sustaining Arctic Grayling population with the mainstem of the river providing critical habitat for fry and adult fish [@shrimptonj.m.GeneticAnalysisArctic2012; @hagen_2015_critical_habs].

<br>

In 2018, the Missinka River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity [@missinka_sens]. Special management is required in the crossing's watershed to protect habitat for Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].



<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to instream (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) habitat with a relatively large channel size (`r my_planning_data %>% pull(downstream_channel_width)`m) and Bull Trout documented upstream (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning)).  The crossing was also ranked by @hooftPrinceGeorgeForest as a high priority for follow up. The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the double culvert (`r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter each) was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-inlet)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_extra_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_extra_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

table_habitat_report %>% filter(Site == my_site) %>% pull(Comments)
drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m. Abundant large woody debris and overhanging vegetation was available for cover and there were large areas of gravels suitable for salmonid spawning present (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2)).  The stream had good flow with an average channel width of `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, an average wetted width of `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and an average gradient of `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat)). No barriers were observed and none were likely located downstream of the area surveyed due to low gradients and significant flow volume. 


<br>

### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat)). Large woody debris and undercut banks were present for cover throughout. There were sections of gravel suitable for spawning and deep pools noted (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2)).

<br>


### Conclusion

There is approximately 2km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r my_site` modeled as less than 22% gradient.  The majority of this habitat is likely of high value with Rainbow Trout presence confirmed up to 1.5km upstream of the crossing [@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.Reconnaissance200001999]. Bull Trout has also been confirmed upstream of the crossing and the watershed is designated as Fisheries Sensitive with critical habitat for the species known nearby. The forest licensee in the area is Sinclar Group and the road tenure holder is the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. Overall, the crossing located on the `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation.
