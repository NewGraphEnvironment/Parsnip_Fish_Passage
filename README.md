Workflows for Phase 1 and 2 Fish Passage Assessment conducted in the Parsnip River watershed in 2019.

This repository builds an [interactive report](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/) that is in the early stages of development, is incomplete and may contain errors.  It is updated regularly and will change substantially with much more detail yet to be added. The report has been made available at this time for stakeholder engagement and to facilitate discussion regarding potential fish passage restoration candidates.  Please contact al@newgraphenvironment.com (2507771518) with any feedback regarding any of the fish passage restoration candidate sites or if you have any questions regarding the project.  Thank you for taking the time to review.

 * The report is generated from scratch from a Rmarkdown document processing raw data from:
 
    + [Checklist for Habitat Confirmation](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/investment-categories/fish-passage/habitat-confirmation-projects) procedures developed by the provincial [Fish Passage Technical Working Group](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/investment-categories/fish-passage) to guide biologists confirming fish habitat value at a stream crossing which has been identified as a potential high‐priority restoration site.

    + [Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, April 16, 2019 ](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/fish/fish-and-fish-habitat-data-information/fish-data-submission/submit-fish-data#submitfish) 

    + [pscis_assessment_template_v23.xls](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/land-based-investment/investment-categories/fish-passage/assessment-projects)


    + Excel spreadsheet with priority level detailed for each of the crossings surveyed.

    + GPS tracks and points from field surveys.  

    + Photos and photo metadata.  When not available in metadata photos georeferenced by aligning photostamp time with GPS track times.



The project workflow is inspired from a drake example from [this chapter of the user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/walkthrough.html). Originally written by [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr).
