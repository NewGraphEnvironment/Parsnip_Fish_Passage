## Crossing `r my_site` - `r my_overview_info %>% pull(road_name)` - `r my_overview_info %>% pull(stream_name)`

```{r}
# test <- pull_data(sheet = loc_data, site = my_site)
##have a look at the watershed
# ggplot(data = my_watershed)+
#   geom_sf(data = my_watershed, lwd = 0.15)
```

### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed tributary to the Parsnip River near the 12.8km mark of the Chuchinka-Table FSR.  The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km from the confluence of the Parsnip River which is located approximately 3km downstream of where the Table River flows into the Parsnip River (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview)). At the time of the field surveys, there was active logging on the FSR. 

<br>

### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is considered 3rd order  with a watershed area upstream of the road of `r my_watershed %>% pull(area_km)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1400m to 760m at the culvert.  One previously unassessed crossing (16603287) is located approximately 200m upstream under the CN Railway. Representatives from Canfor's engineering team report that this crossing is undersized, the culvert is damaged and that water has backed up and overflowed onto the road on two occasions since 2017. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that Rainbow Trout have been captured just upstream of the crossing [@data_fish_obs].

<br>

@hagen_2015_critical_habs have identified the upstream Table River watershed and several tributaries to the Table as containing critical spawning and juvenile rearing habitat for large body Bull Trout with an estimated minimum spawner abundance of 100 fish. 

<br>

The Parsnip River mainstem has been identified as containing critical habitat for juvenile and fry Arctic Grayling.  Additionally, the Table River (along with the Anzac River) just south of the crossing is identified as the primary core of post-Williston Arctic Grayling distribution in the Parsnip River watershed with life history, migration behaviours and critical habitats summarized in @hagen_2015_critical_habs.  The mainstem of the Table River contains critical habitats for all life stages of Arctic Grayling with adults observed moving among mainstem locations and tributaries during summer [@hagen_2015_critical_habs].  


<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to modeled instream habitat (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) with a relatively large channel size (`r my_planning_data %>% pull(downstream_channel_width)`m) and Rainbow Trout documented upstream (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning)). The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and backwatered (`r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m each) crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m to the confluence with the Parsnip River. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2)). Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()`. Gravels suitable for spawning were abundant throughout the area surveyed. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat)). Habitat value downstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`.

<br>

### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m.  Modeled crossing 16603287 was located upstream of the FSR approximately 200m (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-extra1)).  The crossing under the railway was assessed as a barrier with a length of 92m, a diameter of 3m and a slope of 0%. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat)). Riparian vegetation was comprised of a mature coniferous forest and instream cover quantity was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)`.  The dominant cover form was `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` with `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available. Gravels suitable for spawning were present intermittently throughout the area surveyed and the channel morphology was `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'morphology') %>% pull(us)` (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2)). Although there were no permanent barriers, a beaver impounded area was located at the top end of the site (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-upstream3)). Habitat value upstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()`.


<br>


### Conclusion

Although there is approximately 4.5km of mainstem habitat upstream of crossing `r my_site` modeled as less than 22% gradient, there is only 200m of stream between the FSR and the upstream CN Railway culvert barrier. Habitat surveyed was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()` value for salmonids between the FSR and the railway as well as between the railway and the top end of the site surveyed. At the time of the survey, the forest licensees in the area were Sinclar Group and Canadian Forest Products Ltd. The road tenure holder was the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. Overall, the crossing was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation as fish passage restoration at the crossing upstream under the CN Railway would also be required to achieve habitat gains greater than 200m.
