##### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(stream_name)` near the 1km mark of an unnamed road (tenure ID R01821B).  The road is accessed from the Chuchinka-Arctic FSR.  The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km upstream from the confluence with the Parsnip River (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview-125098)). At the time of the field surveys, there appeared to be no active log hauling on the road at the crossing location. 


<br>

##### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is 1st order with watershed elevations ranging from a maximum of 830m to 780m at the culvert. There were no other crossings upstream. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that Rainbow Trout were captured upstream of the crossing by DWB in 2017 [@data_fish_obs].

<br>

Although they concede that information adequacy for assessing critical habitats for Bull Trout in the Upper Parsnip sub-basin is poor, @hagen_2015_critical_habs report that low juvenile Bull Trout density and turbid water conditions indicate that this area is likely of relatively low importance for the Parsnip River population. 


<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a moderate priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the confirmed presence of Rainbow Trout and modeled low gradient habitat upstream (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning-125098)). The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m, a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% and an outlet drop of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(outlet_drop_meters)`m (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert-125098), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert-125098)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

##this is useful to get some comments for the report

drake::readd(table_habitat_report) %>% filter(Site == my_site) %>% pull(Comments)
drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

##### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m. Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant and`r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also present. However, the small stream had very minimal flows with moss present mid-channel indicating low flow volumes were typical for the system (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1-125098) - \@ref(fig:photo-downstream2-125098)). Occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning were noted as present. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125098)).  Riparian vegetation was comprised of a mature coniferous forest. Habitat value downstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()` due to likely very limited rearing and spawning potential resulting from low flow conditions.

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m.  The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125098)). Riparian vegetation was comprised of a mature coniferous forest and total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)`. The dominant cover form was `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` with `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1-125098) - \@ref(fig:photo-upstream2-125098)). Some pockets of gravels suitable for spawning were noted as present. Habitat value downstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()` due to likely very limited rearing and spawning potential resulting from low flow conditions.


<br>


##### Conclusion

Mapping indicates there is 1km of habitat upstream of crossing `r my_site`. Although Rainbow Trout have been recorded upstream, habitat value was rated as low value due to a lack of significant flow volume. Review of Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development (FLNR) licensee operating areas maps indicate that the forest licensee in the area is Sinclar Group however the road tenure holder is detailed as Winton Global Lumber Ltd. [@moeForestTenureRoad2019].  The crossing was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation.
