## Introduction {.tabset}
The health and viability of freshwater fish populations depends on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging as well as overwintering, spawning and summer rearing habitats [@swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @Bramblett_2002].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@tech9_access]. In addition, open migration corridors are essential for adapting to the impacts of climate change such as rising water temperatures and changing flow regimes [@seligerRiverConnectivityHabitat2018]. There are hundreds of culverts presenting barriers to fish passage in the Parsnip River watershed with some of these structures obstructing fish movement to valuable fish habitat [@gollnerPrinceGeorgeTimber2013 ;@hooftPrinceGeorgeForest]. 

<br>

### Background 
As a result of high-level direction from the provincial government of British Columbia, a Fish Passage Strategic Approach protocol has been developed for British Columbia to ensure that the greatest opportunities for restoration of fish passage are pursued.  A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS) which has been built to house all culvert related data.  Historically, British Columbia Timber Sales has administered most of the fish passage assessment, design and remediation contracts in the province with the majority of funding typically provided by the Land Based Investment Strategy (LBIS). The strategic approach protocol for fish passage restoration involves a four-phase process as described in [@fptwg_strategic_approach]:

 * Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity.
 * Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation.
 * Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed.  
 * Phase 4: Remediation – Implementation of re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 

<br>

The scope of this project included planning and implementation for Phase 2 of the strategic approach protocol in the Parsnip River watershed.  The Parsnip River watershed was chosen for habitat confirmation actions due to its high fisheries values, because it is a watershed impacted by dam operations and because there has been significant investment in Phase 1 assessments since 2001 with 574 assessments for fish passage already completed.

### Study Area 
The Parsnip River watershed is located within the south-eastern portion of the 108,000 km^2^ traditional territory of the Tse'khene from the [McLeod Lake Indian Band](https://www.mlib.ca/about/History).  The Tse'khene *"People of the Rocks"* are a south westerly extension of the Athabascan speaking people of northern Canada.  They were a nomadic hunting people who's language belongs to the Beaver-Sarcee-Tse'khene branch of Athapaskan [@HistoryWhoWe]. 

<br>

The continental divide separates watersheds flowing north into the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and south and west into the Pacific Ocean via the Fraser River. The Parsnip River is a 6th order stream with a watershed that drains an area of `r round(watershed_raw$area/100, 0)` km^2^. The mainstem of the river flows within the Rocky Mountain Trench in a north direction into Williston Reservoir starting from the continental divide adjacent to Arctic Lakes. Major tributaries include the Misinchinka, Colbourne, Reynolds, Anzac, Table, Hominka and Missinka sub-basins which drain the western slopes of the Hart Ranges of the Rocky Mountains.  The Parsnip River has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "07EE007")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the northern Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology2-print) - \@ref(fig:hydrosummaryplot)). 

<br>

Construction of the 183 m high and 2134 m long W.A.C. Bennett Dam was completed in 1967 at Hudson's Hope, BC, creating Williston Reservoir [@hirst_1991].  Filling of the 375 km^2^ reservoir was complete in 1972 and flooded a substantial portion of the Parsnip River and major tributary valleys forming what is now known as the Peace and Parsnip reaches. The replacement of riverine habitat with an inundated reservoir environment resulted in profound changes to the ecology, resource use and human settlement patterns in these systems [@hagen_2015_critical_habs; @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling; @pearceTSEKHENEFIRST2019]. Prior to the filling of the reservoir, the Pack River, into which McLeod Lake flows, was a major tributary to the Parsnip River.  It now enters the Williston Reservoir directly as the historic location of the confluence of the two rivers lies within the reservoir's footprint.

### Fisheries {.tabset}
Fish species recorded in the Parsnip River watershed are detailed in Table \@ref(tab:table-fish) [@data_fish_obs]. In addition to flooding related to the formation of the Williston Reservoir, transmission lines, gas pipelines, rail, road networks, forestry, elevated water temperatures, interrupted connectivity, invasion from non-native species and insect infestations affecting forested areas pose threats to fisheries values in the Parsnip River watershed [@hagen_2015_critical_habs; @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling; @bull_trout_synthesis; @bt_cosewic]. 

<br>

```{r table-fish}
##@pearceTSEKHENEFIRST2019 reports that Tse'khene elders participating in information gathering on Kokanee, Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling have a holistic, integrative perspective of the environment and consider individual fish species as components of a complex web of environmental relationships.

<br>

#### Bull Trout

Bull Trout populations of the Williston Reservoir watershed are included within the Western Arctic 'Designatable Unit', which, in 2012, received a ranking of ‘Special Concern’ by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada  [@bt_cosewic].  A study of Bull Trout critical habitats in the Parsnip River was conducted in 2014 with the Misinchinka and Anzac systems identified as the most important systems for large bodied bull trout spawners accounting for a combined total of 65% of spawners counted.  The Table River was also highlighted as an important spawning destination accounting for an estimated 15% of the spawners.  Other watersheds identified as containing runs of large bodied Bull Trout spawners included the Colbourne, Reynolds, Hominka and Missinka River with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing each sub-basin [@hagen_2015_critical_habs].  @bull_trout_synthesis have synthesized a large body of information regarding limiting factors, enhancement potential, critical habitats and conservation status for Bull Trout of the Williston Reservoir and the reader is encouraged to review this work for context.  They have recommended experimental enhancements within a monitoring framework for Williston Reservoir Bull Trout (some spawning and rearing in Parsnip River mainstem and tributaries) which include stream fertilization, side channel development, riparian restoration and fish access improvement.  

<br>

In 2018, sub-basins of the Anzac River watershed, Homininka River, Missinki River and Table River watersheds were designated as fisheries sensitive watersheds under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* due to significant downstream fisheries values and significant watershed sensitivity [@anzac_sens; @hominka_sens; @table_sens; @missinka_sens]. Special management is required in these watersheds to protect habitat for fish species including Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling including measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].    

<br>


#### Arctic Grayling
A detailed review of Arctic Grayling life history can be referenced in @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling. Since impoundment of the Williston Reservoir, it appears that physical habitat and ecological changes have been the most significant factors limiting Arctic Grayling productivity. Although these changes are not well understood they have likely resulted in the inundation of key low gradient juvenile rearing and overwintering habitats, isolation of previously connected populations and increases in abundance of predators such as Bull Trout [@shrimptonj.m.GeneticAnalysisArctic2012; @hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018].  

<br>

Migration of mature adult Arctic Grayling occurs in the spring with arrival at known spawning locations coinciding with water temperatures of 4 $^\circ$C.  Spawning in the Parsnip watershed appears to occur between late-May and late-June within sites located primarily within the lower reaches of the Anzac and Table rivers as well as within the Parsnip River mainstem. Side-channel and multiple-channel locations containing small gravels appear to be selected for spawning. Currently, the primary distribution of Williston Arctic Grayling appears to be among fourth order and larger streams [@williamson_2004; @stamfordFWCPArcticGrayling].   Although past study results indicate that 0+ grayling appeared to overwinter in lower reaches of larger tributaries (i.e. Table, Anzac rivers) as well as the Parsnip River and that few age-1+ grayling have been sampled in tributaries, habitat use in small tributaries and the extent they are connected with the mainstem habitats of all core areas is not well understood. Between 1995 and 2019, Arctic Grayling population monitoring has been conducted in the Table River in nine out of 25 years (8 years for the Anzac) using snorkel surveys.  Results from 2018 are 2019 are intended to contributing to assessment of the conservation status of the species in the Parsnip Core area [@hagenTrendAbundanceArctic2018].

<br>


## Goals and Objectives
The overall goal of our project was to build capacity, awareness and momentum for fish passage restoration in the Parsnip Watershed. To realize this goal we created a short list of high priority culverts for fish passage restoration in the Parsnip River watershed through a data analysis exercise, scoping for First Nations input, fish passage assessments [@fish_passage_assessments], habitat confirmation assessments [@confirmation_checklist] and procurement of design specifications for a prioritized crossing.

```

To identify priorities for crossing structure rehabilitation, background literature and the PSCIS database was reviewed for Parsnip River watershed streams and potential fish habitat associated with barrier and potential barrier culverts was analyzed within the context of outputs from the Fish Habitat Model [@fish_habitat_model]. The Fish Habitat Model was developed by the BC Ministry of Environment to provide estimates of the amount of fish habitat potentially located upstream of crossing locations.

<br>

Past fish passage assessment reports for the Parsnip River watershed were first reviewed to identify crossing structure barriers previously ranked as high or moderate priorities for rehabilitation.  All crossings prioritized in past contractor reports underwent a detailed office review and ranking for follow up in the field.  To identify previously un-prioritized crossing structure barriers located on potentially high value streams, road crossing structures that met the following criteria in the Fish Habitat Model and/or PSCIS database also underwent a detailed review to rank crossings for Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmations.

<br>

 * Stream crossing barriers and potential barriers on streams with confirmed fish presence upstream of the structure.
 * Stream crossing barriers and potential barriers on streams documented as ≥ 1.5m wide with linear lengths of modeled upstream habitat <22% gradient for ≥500 m.
 * Stream crossing barriers and potential barriers located on streams classified as 3rd order or higher.
 * Stream crossing barriers and potential barriers located on streams with >5 ha of modeled wetland and/or lake habitat upstream of the structure.
 * Stream crossing barriers and potential barriers on streams with habitat value rated as "medium" or “high” in past fish passage assessment data.  
 
<br>

A .kml file with crossing locations and rational for prioritizing for habitat confirmations was forwarded to provincial fish habitat biologists, McLeod Lake Indian Band staff, representatives from CN Rail, BC Timber Sales and Canfor Forest Products to provide an opportunity for review and scope for feedback.

<br>

In the field, PSCIS crossings ranked as high priorities for follow-up were assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” (MoE 2011) to confirm that the crossings were still barriers to fish passage. The following criteria, which act as hydraulic indices, were utilized to determine if a crossing was a barrier to fish passage: depth and degree of embedment, outlet drop, slope of culvert, stream width ratio (ratio of average downstream channel width to culvert width), and length of the culvert. 

<br>

Habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (FPTWG 2011). The main objective was to confirm that upstream habitat quantity and quality is sufficient to justify remediation of the crossing to provide fish passage, and to determine if any obstructions exist below the crossing. Structure replacement can be justified if there is a large quantity of high value habitat upstream of crossing barriers provided there are no fish migration barriers immediately downstream or upstream of the crossing.

# <br>
# 
#    The model calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas [stream network lines](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/freshwater-atlas-stream-network) at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end and working upstream.  The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created when the average gradient of the stream lines exceeds user provided gradient thresholds.  For our purposes, stream network line segments were grouped into areas upstream of sections not exceeding 5% (0 - 5%), 5- 15%, 15 - 22% and >22%.  Stream areas upstream of gradients estimated at >22% for more than 100m were considered non-fish habitat if no fish observations had been documented upstream. For each crossing location, the linear length of stream habitat upstream of crossings and <22% was calculated to give an indication of the potential habitat gain should fish passage be restored.  
# 
# <br>
# 
# Following delineation of "non-fish habitat", the *average* gradient of each stream segment created by the Fish Habitat Model was also calculated and used to symbolize stream lines based on stream morphology.  We used average gradients associated with riffle/cascade (0 - 5%), step-pool (5 - 15%), and step-pool very steep (15 -22%) fish habitats (Table \@ref(tab:tablethreshaverage)).

## Results

Review of the PSCIS database indicated that within the Parsnip River watershed, since `r min(pscis_historic_references$year)`, `r length(pscis_historic$id)` assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) have been conducted at crossing structures. Locations of 99 crossing structure assessments received a detailed review with 26 crossings given a high priority for field review with habitat confirmation assessments. Additionally, thirty-three crossings were assessed with a moderate priority for review with habitat confirmation assessments. Historic PSCIS photos and details, Fish Habitat Model outputs and prioritization rank/comments related to crossings ranked for follow up with habitat confirmation assessments is available <a href="Parsnip_report_planning_summary.html">here</a>.  Field maps showing crossing locations and Fish Habitat Model outputs, historic fish observations and documented barriers to fish passage are available [here](https://hillcrestgeo.ca/outgoing/forNewGraph/pars_maps/) and a .kml file with crossing locations and prioritization rational is available  [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/Parsnip_Fish_Passage/raw/master/data/planning_high_mod_culverts.zip).

Habitat confirmation assessments were conducted between August 30, 2019 and September 8, 2019 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio, Jonathan St.John, R.P.Bio, Tyler Valle, Environmental Technician and Ken Solonas, Environmental Technician with 20 of the 26 crossings ranked as high priority for field review and one crossing ranked as moderate priority surveyed in the field.  Several crossings were surveyed briefly from the road with habitat confirmation assessments not completed due to passable conditions for downstream fish. Crossing 125149 was an overflow for an adjacent channel where a bridge was located, crossing 57621 had been replaced by a bridge and crossing 125261 was equipped with baffles and appeared passable to most life stages of salmonids at most flows. Seventeen habitat confirmations are presented in the "Overview Map" and "Overview Table" sections of this report.  A total of approximately 15 km of stream was assessed and fish sampling (primarily minnow trapping) was conducted upstream and downstream of six restoration candidate sites.  

<br>

Following habitat confirmation assessments, nine crossings were rated as high priorities for rehabilitation due to the relatively high value and/or quantity of habitat gain associated with rehabilitation. Three crossings were rated as moderate priorities. Five crossings were rated as low priority since the fisheries value gains associated with crossing rehabilitation were relatively low and/or where the presence of natural barriers would nullify the potential value of crossing rehabilitation. Detailed summaries of each of the habitat confirmations are currently being drafted and will be added to the report soon.
