##### Site Location

Crossing `r my_site` is located on an unnamed tributary to the Missinka River near the 1289.2km mark of an unnamed road. The road is accessed from the Chuckinka-Missinka FSR and is located on the south side of the Missinka River.  The culvert is located `r my_distance_downstream`km from the confluence of the stream and the Missinka River (Table \@ref(tab:tableoverview-125128)). At the time of the field surveys, there appeared to be no active log hauling and extended sections of the road were overgrown with shrubs.  The site was accessed by ATV.


<br>

##### Background Information

At the crossing location, the stream is a 3rd order stream with a watershed area upstream of the road of approximately `r my_watershed %>% pull(area_km)`km^2^. Although upstream tributaries are not mapped below 1000m the elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1560m to 920m at the culvert. No other crossings are modeled upstream. 

<br>

Provincial records indicate that Rainbow Trout, Mountain Whitefish, Sculpin, and Burbot have been captured in the subject stream approximately 400m downstream of the crossing [@data_fish_obs; @tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.Reconnaissance200001999]. Review of  @tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.Reconnaissance200001999 maps indicates that no fish were captured at a sample site located approximately 700m upstream of the crossing within a small tributary to a wetland area.

<br>

@hagen_2015_critical_habs have identified the Missinka River watershed as containing critical spawning habitat for large body adult Bull Trout with potentially less than 50 spawners utilizing the watershed.  Critical juvenile rearing habitat is also noted as present [@hagen_2015_critical_habs]. Additionally, the Missinka River watershed is utilized by a possibly genetically distinct, self-sustaining Arctic Grayling population with the mainstem of the river providing critical habitat for fry and adult fish [@shrimptonj.m.GeneticAnalysisArctic2012; @hagen_2015_critical_habs].

<br>

In 2018, the Missinka River watershed was designated as a fisheries sensitive watershed under the authority of the *Forest and Range Practices Act* due to significant downstream fisheries values and watershed sensitivity [@missinka_sens]. Special management is required in the crossing's watershed to protect habitat for Bull Trout and Arctic Grayling and includes measures (among others) to limit equivalent clearcut area, reduce impacts to natural stream channel morphology, retain old growth attributes and maintain fish habitat/movement [@fsw_order].



<br>

Following office review, PSCIS stream crossing `r my_site` was ranked as a high priority for follow up with habitat confirmation due to the potential for rehabilitation of the crossing to provide access to modeled instream (`r my_overview_info %>% pull(uphab_gross_sub22)`km) and wetland (`r my_overview_info %>% mutate(upstr_awet_gross_all = round(upstr_awet_gross_all,1)) %>% pull(upstr_awet_gross_all)`ha) habitat and due to a past habitat value rating assessed as medium.  Review of historic fisheries information also indicated a 1.9m wide channel located well upstream of the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:table-planning-125128)). The habitat confirmation was completed on `r date`. A map of the watershed including areas surveyed is provided in Attachment 1 â€“ Map [`r my_mapsheet`](`r my_map_link`).

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics at Crossing

At the time of the survey, the un-embedded and non-backwatered `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(diameter_or_span_meters)`m diameter crossing was considered a barrier to upstream fish passage with a pipe length of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(length_or_width_meters)`m and a culvert slope of `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(culvert_slope_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tableculvert-125128), Figure \@ref(fig:photo-culvert-125128)). Water temperature was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(temperature_c)`$^\circ$C and conductivity was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(conductivity_m_s_cm)`uS/cm.

drake::readd(priorities_spreadsheet) %>% filter(site == my_site) %>% pull(comments_for_submission_with_fish_permit)

```

##### Stream Characteristics Downstream

The stream was surveyed downstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_ds %>% pull(length)`m to below a 5m high cascade (10 m long at 50% gradient) and a subsequent 12m long cascade with gradients of 32% (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-extra1-125128)). Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(ds)` with  `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` dominant (Figures \@ref(fig:photo-downstream1-125128)). Cover was also present as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(ds == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()`. The average channel width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% mutate(avg_wetted_width_m = round(avg_wetted_width_m,1)) %>%  pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_ds %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125128)). Habitat downstream of the crossing was rated as medium value with moderate rearing potential for Burbot, Bull Trout, Rainbow Trout and other salmonid species.

<br>

##### Stream Characteristics Upstream

The stream was surveyed upstream from the culvert for `r my_priority_info_us %>% pull(length)`m to where an extensive wetland area began (Figure \@ref(fig:photo-upstream1-125128). The average channel width before the wetland was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_channel_width_m)`m, the average wetted width was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(avg_wetted_width_m)`m and the average gradient was `r my_habitat_info_us %>% pull(average_gradient_percent)`% (Table \@ref(tab:tablehabitat-125128)). Overall, total cover amount was rated as `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(rowname == 'total cover') %>% pull(us)` with the dominant cover form `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'dominant') %>% pull(rowname)` and `r my_habitat_info_t %>% filter(us == 'sub-dominant') %>% pull(rowname) %>% knitr::combine_words()` also available. Habitat value upstream of the crossing was rated as `r my_pscis_info %>% pull(habitat_value) %>% tolower()` as there was no suitable spawning habitat present for salmonids and low rearing potential due to the assumed shallow typical depth of the wetland.


<br>


##### Conclusion

There is approximately 0.7km of mainstem habitat within an extensive wetland area upstream of crossing `r my_site`. However, large bodied Bull Trout are likely the only species potentially capable of getting over the steep cascade sections located just downstream of the road.  Additionally, the likely shallow depths present in the wetland and a likely absence of habitat suitable for rearing or spawning upstream of the wetland areas due to the small size of tributary watersheds are likely not conducive to Bull Trout spawning and rearing.  The forest licensee in the area are Sinclar Group and the road tenure holder is the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations & Rural Development. Overall, the crossing was ranked as a `r tolower(my_priority_info_us %>% pull(priority))` priority for rehabilitation.
